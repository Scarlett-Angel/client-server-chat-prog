Hi there,

EPWinsock 1.12.24.0
.NET FRAMEWORK 4.0

I want to show how to use EPWinsock to send Multilanguage messages over TCP Sockets.

You might need to watch previous videos to get how to add a dll reference to your project. 

You should have the EPWinSock.v4 on your project.

ALL files can be downloaded somwhere below this youtube page.

You only need to use the Send Data method to send your desired information.

and receive it under DataReceived Event.

Thanks for watching,
