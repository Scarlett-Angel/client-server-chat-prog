Hi, Welcome to the walkthrough video on using EPWinsock

The Latest Assembly Version is EPWinsock 1.10.7
You can get the dll from the link below.


The serverapp we will be using already has a List View control.

I will be showing you how to list connected client PC information in this tutorial with few lines of code.


The main difference in this Server GUI from the previous demonstration is that I changed the client list control from listbox to listview so we can see other information like IP Address, Mac Address, Operating System


The Client GUI remain the same


You should check public also if you will be using it on public lan else it will be working locally on your pc. Enable the firewall

Now it is enabled

Lets run the client

The client is connected with its information listed

Thou this was written in VB.NET ..The same is applicable in C#.

Lets disconnect the client.

If you need to ask anything. Feel free to comment below.

Happy coding)
